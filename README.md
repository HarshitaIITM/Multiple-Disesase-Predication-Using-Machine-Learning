# Multiple-Disesase-Predication-Using-Machine-Learning

Description:

Welcome to the Multiple Disease Prediction project repository! This repository presents a comprehensive machine learning solution for predicting multiple diseases including diabetes, heart disease, and Parkinson's disease. Early detection and accurate prediction of these conditions play a crucial role in preventive healthcare and personalized treatment strategies.

Key Features:

Dataset Compilation: Curated and compiled datasets containing relevant medical features and labels for diabetes, heart disease, and Parkinson's disease prediction tasks are provided. These datasets are sourced from reputable healthcare repositories and research publications.

Data Preprocessing: The preprocessing pipeline involves data cleaning, feature engineering, and normalization to ensure the quality and consistency of input data for machine learning models.

Model Development: Machine learning models tailored for each disease prediction task are developed. For diabetes ,heart disease and Parkinson's disease prediction, algorithms such as Support Vector Machines (SVM), Decision Trees, and Linear Regression are employed.

Model Evaluation: The performance of each disease prediction model is rigorously evaluated using appropriate evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Cross-validation techniques are employed to ensure robustness and generalizability of the models.

Hyperparameter Tuning: Hyperparameter tuning is conducted to optimize the performance of the models, utilizing techniques like grid search and random search to find the optimal set of hyperparameters.

Deployment: Instructions and scripts for model deployment are provided, enabling users to make predictions on new medical data or integrate the models into healthcare applications for real-time disease prediction.

Documentation: Detailed documentation accompanies the project, including explanations of data sources, preprocessing steps, model architectures, and usage guidelines, facilitating easy understanding and replication of the predictive models.

Web Application with Streamlit: Explore our interactive web application built with Streamlit to make predictions and visualize results easily.
